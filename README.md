# Face-Mask-and-Social-Distancing-Detection
This is a real-time face mask detection and social distancing monitoring system using OpenCV and deep learning. The project utilizes a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect whether people are wearing masks or not and employs computer vision techniques to ensure social distancing is maintained.
